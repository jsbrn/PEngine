# PEngine #

A platformer engine written in Java's Swing framework. It is primarily designed for narrative-based 2D sidescrollers, featuring drag-and-drop world building, and a flowchart logic builder to manipulate objects in the game. It started as a simple way to assemble levels for a narrative game I was trying to make, and then escalated from there.

# What makes this project cool? #

1. The most ambitious part of this project is the logic designer. Objects in the worlds you create can be animated and manipulated by dragging and dropping actions (or "blocks") onto the canvas and connecting them in order.

2. I've also written a runtime .jar which interprets the project files that are generated by the engine. It's in a different repository.

# How do I try it? #

I built this in Netbeans' Swing editor, so the GUI forms aren't universally compatible. You'll need to import this project into Netbeans 7+ in order to contribute.
